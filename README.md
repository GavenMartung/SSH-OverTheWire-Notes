Notes on OverTheWires Bandit SSH Guide/Game(This will be consistantly changed as I learn more)

SSH : connect to secure socket shell
username@hostname.com : ussually what the host name looks like if you have a username
-p : appends a port to the server
du : Disk Usage Comman
cat : When seeing a dashed file name, you have to use the cat command, so cat<FILENAMEexit
//If there are spaces in the filename, you can use "" to input it, so cat <"spaces in filename"
ls -a : used to find hidden files, specifically the -a
find : allows for the search of files based on certain criteria
-size : append to find to search based on the size of the desired file
